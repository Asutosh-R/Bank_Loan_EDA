* We can see that Female contribute 67% to the non-defaulters while 57% to the defaulters. We can conclude that
* We see more female applying for loans than males and hence the more number of female defaulters as well.
* But the rate of defaulting of FEMALE is much lower compared to their MALE counterparts.

We can see that people with cars contribute 65.7% to the non-defaulters while 69.5% to the defaulters. We can conclude that while people who have car default more often, the reason could be there are simply more people without cars. 
Looking at the percentages in both the charts, we can conclude that the rate of default of people having car is low compared to people who don't.
